    "By formal definition, multithreading refers to the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently, where each thread runs a process. Whereas multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to run multiple processors concurrently, where each processor can run one or more threads.\n",

    "\n",
    "multithreading--------- multiple threads share the same code, data, and files but run on a different register and stack. \n",

    "\n",
    "Multithreading is useful for IO-bound processes, such as reading files from a network or database since each thread can run the IO-bound process concurrently. Multiprocessing is useful for CPU-bound processes, such as computationally heavy tasks since it will benefit from having multiple processors; similar to how multicore computers work faster than computers with a single core."
