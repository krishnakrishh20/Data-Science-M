        "Measures of dispersion, including range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to quantify the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide valuable insights into how the individual data points are distributed around the central tendency measures, such as the mean or median. Here's how each measure is used and an example illustrating their application:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Range:\n",
        "   - The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
        "   - It provides a rough estimate of the spread of data but is sensitive to outliers.\n",
        "   - The larger the range, the more spread out the data points are.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example: Suppose you have a dataset representing the heights (in inches) of students in a class:\n",
        "   Heights = [60, 62, 65, 68, 70]\n",
        "   The range would be: Range = Max(Heights) - Min(Heights) = 70 - 60 = 10 inches.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Variance:\n",
        "   - Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean of the dataset.\n",
        "   - It provides a more precise measure of spread than the range and considers all data points in the calculation.\n",
        "   - Larger variance values indicate greater variability in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Example continuation: Using the same heights dataset,\n",
        "   Heights = [60, 62, 65, 68, 70]\n",
        "   First, calculate the mean height: Mean = (60 + 62 + 65 + 68 + 70) / 5 = 325 / 5 = 65 inches.\n",
        "   Next, calculate the variance:\n",
        "   Variance = [(60 - 65)^2 + (62 - 65)^2 + (65 - 65)^2 + (68 - 65)^2 + (70 - 65)^2] / 5\n",
        "            = [(25) + (9) + (0) + (9) + (25)] / 5\n",
        "            = 68 / 5\n",
        "            = 13.6 square inches.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Standard Deviation:\n",
        "   - The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n",
        "   - It represents the average deviation of data points from the mean and is expressed in the same units as the original data.\n",

        "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables (positive, negative, or no relationship) and the magnitude of their joint variability. However, the scale of covariance depends on the scales of the variables being measured, making it difficult to interpret the strength of the relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1, where +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. Unlike covariance, correlation is unitless and allows for easier interpretation of the strength and direction of the relationship between variables. It also helps in assessing the strength of the relationship relative to other relationships."

        "1. Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
        "   - Mean: Outliers can heavily influence the mean because it takes into account every value in the dataset. A single extreme value can pull the mean towards it, making it unrepresentative of the majority of the data.\n",
        "   - Median: Outliers have minimal effect on the median, as it represents the middle value when the dataset is ordered. Since it's not influenced by extreme values, it can provide a more robust measure of central tendency in the presence of outliers.\n",
        "   - Mode: Outliers generally have little to no effect on the mode, as it represents the most frequently occurring value. Unless the outlier occurs frequently enough to create a new mode, it typically doesn't impact the mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Measures of Dispersion:\n",
        "   - Range: Outliers can significantly affect the range, especially if they are extreme values. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset, so extreme outliers can widen the range.\n",
        "   - Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can inflate the variance and standard deviation, as these measures consider the deviation of each data point from the mean. Since outliers can be far from the mean, they contribute to larger deviations and increase the variability in the dataset.\n",
