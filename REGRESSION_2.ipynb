        "   - Regularized linear models assume linear relationships between predictors and the target variable. They may not capture complex non-linear relationships effectively.\n",
        "   - In cases where the relationship between predictors and the target variable is highly non-linear, regularized linear models may not provide accurate predictions or model interpretations.\n",

        "   - Regularized linear models can still be sensitive to outliers, especially when the regularization parameter is not properly tuned.\n",

        "\n",
        "In summary, while regularized linear models offer benefits such as improved generalization performance and prevention of overfitting, they also have limitations such as loss of interpretability, challenges in handling collinearity, difficulty in parameter tuning, limited applicability to non-linear relationships, and sensitivity to outliers. It is essential to carefully consider these limitations and assess whether regularized linear models are the most appropriate choice for a given regression analysis task. In some cases, alternative modeling techniques such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting may offer better performance and interpretability."
