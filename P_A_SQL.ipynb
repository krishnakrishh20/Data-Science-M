    "SQL-Safe and versatile, it’s particularly well suited for complex queries.SQL restricts the user to working within a predefined tabular schema, and more care must be taken to organize and understand the data before it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOSQL-There is less emphasis on planning, greater freedom when adding new attributes or fields, and the possibility of varied syntax across databases. As a group, however, NoSQL languages lack the standard interface which SQL provides, so more complex queries can be difficult to execute.\n",
