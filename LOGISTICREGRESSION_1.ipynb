        "   - Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category.\n",

The outcome variable here is binary (purchase or not purchase). In this case, logistic regression would be more appropriate because it can model the probability of a customer making a purchase based on the given features, providing insights into the likelihood of a purchase rather than predicting a continuous outcome like the amount spent on the purchase, which would be the domain of linear regression."
